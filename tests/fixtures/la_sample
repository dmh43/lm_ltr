<TEXT>

The onset of the new Gorbachev policy of glasnost, commonly mistranslated as 
openness but closer in connotation to candor or publicizing, has complicated 
the task of Soviet secret-keepers and has allowed substantial new Western 
insights into Soviet society. David R. Marples' new book, his second on the 
Chernobyl accident of April 26, 1986, is a shining example of the best type of 
non-Soviet analysis into topics that only recently were absolutely taboo in 
Moscow official circles. 
</P>
<P>
The author, a British-educated historian and economist, is a research associate 
with the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Alberta, 
and the academic style of the book is undisguised. However, its intended 
audience is the general public, and anyone interested in nuclear power, or 
Soviet economy and society, or human drama, or just plain sleuthing state 
secrets, will find hitherto unpublished revelations and explanations of the 
event and its continuing aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
The effects of Chernobyl reverberated throughout so many facets of Soviet 
society that a continuous coherent narrative is probably impossible. Marples 
discusses half a dozen major themes arranged in a fairly arbitrary order (as 
indicated by the frequent and helpful cross references throughout the text) and 
succeeds in mapping out his main themes. The personal interests of each reader 
determine which of the sections may be deemed too detailed and which too 
sketchy, but considering the need for such a comprehensive overview, the levels 
are generally appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The book is, on the one hand, not a light read, and an executive summary might 
have been possible in a quarter the length. But, on the other, so many of the 
judgments depend on a subtle interpretation of a multitude of sources that the 
author is obligated to present the raw data for the reader's inspection. The 
modular nature of the book also allows a reader to skip, browse, and revisit 
earlier sections, aided by a convenient internal organization and a thorough 
index. 
</P>
<P>
First in the world's attention, and in the text, is a discussion of the human 
victims of the accident. The official tally is 31 (only about 20 names have 
ever been released), but Marples suspects there were other short-term radiation 
victims. A large number of unnecessary late-term abortions were also performed 
on local women, and by rights those unborn babies count as casualties. 
Widespread "radiophobia" led to restricted diets which created malnourishment 
and subsequent disease in thousands of people. The tens of thousands of people 
taking part in cleanup operations were never included in official totals of 
those exposed. Since the book went to press, Soviet military sources have 
referred to at least one death in the actual reactor entombment program. 
</P>
<P>
But the greatest toll is likely to occur with the delayed deaths. Here, Marples 
encounters for the first time the soon familiar theme of official Soviet 
myth-making around the event: Reality is twisted to serve state policy 
objectives, which include calming an alarmed public with assurances that all is 
well when it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
And thus is born what he properly labels the "myth of Chernobyl," the official 
line that the disaster provided a test that Soviet society passed with honor. 
"In the Soviet view," he writes, "it was first and foremost a victory, a story 
with an ending, and an ending that was triumphant." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when sober Western medical estimates placed the future "excess cancer 
deaths" at several tens of thousands, both in the Soviet Union and in Europe (a 
few tenths of a percent elevation of the natural cancer rate), the Soviets 
reacted furiously. The estimates are branded "nonsense" and the estimators are 
dismissed as "panic mongers" promulgating "anti-Soviet venom." 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently the author addresses themes of environmental impact, economic and 
political repercussions, public images, and the recovery operations. Along the 
way, Marples provides a damning list of examples in which Soviet officials 
attempted to retreat behind old-style cover-ups and outright lies. False 
information was issued on radiation levels, on subsequent accidents at the 
site, on contamination levels of the Kiev water supply, on severe discipline 
against non-volunteer cleanup personnel, on reactor entombment schedules and on 
operator training levels. 
</P>
<P>
A severe 1986-1987 countrywide electrical power shortage was officially denied 
although it was real enough to compel the restart of three Chernobyl reactors 
in explicit violation of Soviet safety regulations. Design deficiencies of the 
Chernobyl-style reactors were downplayed and human errors were declared to be 
the primary culprit. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, observes the author, "It is ironic that in an era of openness, 
Chernobyl may have been both the pioneer of glasnost under Gorbachev and then 
subsequently its first casualty." He ultimately concludes, "Aspects of the 
disaster . . . have rarely been dealt with thoroughly or even honestly by 
Soviet sources." Hence the need for this book, a need which is admirably 
fulfilled despite the many remaining mysteries and uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
The July, 1987, trial of reactor personnel marked a full circle of disclosure. 
Journalists were allowed into the pre-scripted first and last days, but the 
weeklong deliberative sessions were held in secret and no word of their 
substance has ever been released. 
</P>
<P>
The propaganda purpose of the trial and surrounding official publicity, he 
maintains, had one goal: "To divert culpability from the party hierarchy, in 
Kiev and especially in Moscow." This is precisely the theme I have also 
encountered in my own investigations of aerospace accidents of the past. Where 
individual human failings led to catastrophe, a sanitized story may eventually 
be released, but where Kremlin policy led to disaster (such as the Nedelin 
catastrophe of 1960 or the Soyuz-1 disaster in 1967), the entire event remains 
absolutely off limits to glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
The closing blow-by-blow description of the nuclear power debate presages a 
dramatic event which occurred too recently for inclusion in this first edition. 
Viktor Legasov, tagged by the author as one of the country's two leading 
pro-nuclear advocates, actually was sinking into private despair over the poor 
implementation of safety standards. In the end, he made his final and most 
eloquent testimony to this despair on the second anniversary of the accident, 
by committing suicide. For several weeks the Soviets tried to sit on the 
circumstances of his "tragic death," even issuing official non-explanations 
which asserted that the death was not due to medical effects of radiation. 
Finally, crusading journalist Vladimir Gubarev, with access to Legasov's 
notebooks, broke the story in Pravda. Readers of this book will come to know 
these and other characters so well that the suicide fits right into the "big 
picture" of the catastrophe's social impacts. 
</P>
<P>
For an author to so accurately describe a social milieu that subsequent 
unpredictable events only enhance his insights is testimony to the highest 
quality of scholarship. Readers of Marples' book will rarely be surprised as 
the Chernobyl catastrophe's consequences continue to unfold in the future.

Photo, Chernobyl Then and Now :Photographs of the damaged reactor taken before 
the construction of its concrete "sarcophagus" are, for obvious reasons, aerial 
photographs. Left, an artist's reconstruction of the reactor as it would have 
looked from the ground before the sarcophagus was in place. The point of view 
is the same as that of an official Soviet photograph, right, taken as the 
entombment neared completion.
