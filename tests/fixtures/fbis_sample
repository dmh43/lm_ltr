POLITICIANS,  PARTY PREFERENCES 

   Summary:  Newspapers in the Former Yugoslav Republic of 
   Macedonia have published the results of opinion polls, 
   indicating the relative popularity of politicians, 
   political parties, and attitudes toward the political system. 

   The 22-23 January edition of the Skopje newspaper VECER in 
Macedonian published on pages 6-7 the results of an opinion poll 
conducted by the "BriMa" agency in November 1993. According to 
VECER, 1,036 respondents were classified by age and residence, but 
the paper did not explain the methodology or give the margin of 
error.  For the purpose of comparison, the paper cited the results 
of an unidentified poll made in May 1993. The approval/disapproval 
ratings, in percent, for ten Macedonian politicians were: 

                                           November 1993    May 1993 

Kiro Gligorov, President of the Republic      76/15           78/13 

Vasil Tupurkovski, former Macedonian          50/36           43/37 
   official in Federal Yugoslavia 

Ljubomir Frckovski, Interior Minister         50/42           42/43 

Stojan Andov, Parliamentary Chairman          48/41           48/39 

Branko Crvenkovski, Prime Minister            46/41           44/38 

Vlado Popovski, Defense Minister              41/41           36/37 

Stevo Crvenkovski, Foreign Minister           40/43   No Data Given 

Petar Gosev, Democratic Party leader          34/53           40/42 

Todor Petrov, Independent parliamentarian     32/53   No Data Given 

Nikola Popovski, Social Democratic            29/46           32/42 
   Party parliamentarian 

   VECER noted that President Gligorov's very high approval rating 
of 90 percent among those over age 65 fell off to a still high 70 
percent among respondents between 18 and 24.  Residents of Skopje 
ranked the politicians in a slightly different order from the 
ranking given by the whole sample: Gligorov, Tupurkovski, Frckovski, 
Andov, Gosev, Branko Crvenkovski, Vlado Popovski, Petrov, Nikola 
Popovski, and Stevo Crvenkovski. 

   The results of a series of opinion polls conducted by the Agency 
for Public Opinion Research and published "exclusively" by the 
Skopje weekly PULS newspaper, confirmed Gligorov's substantial lead 
in popularity among political figures.  According to the 31 December 
1993 issue of PULS (pages 16-18), the agency gathered the data by 
means of telephone interviews with 300 residents in the Republic of 
Macedonia during 20-24 December. PULS also provided data from 
surveys made in March, June, and September for comparison.  Some of 
the following percentages are approximate values that were derived 
from the graph published by the paper: 

                         March       June      September    December 

Kiro Gligorov             87          82.33      89.33           89

   On pages 6 and 7 of its 15-16 January issue, VECER also published 
the results of a November 1993 survey on party preferences. 
"BriMa," working with the Gallup organization, interviewed 1,036 
people. 

   Question: "If elections were held today, for which party would 
you vote?" (all numbers are percentages) 

SDSM (Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia)  22.8 
VMRO-DPMNE                                      11.2 
Democratic Party (DP, led by Petar Gosev)        6.3 
Socialist Party                                  3.3 
Liberal Party (LP)                               3.2 
Workers Party                                    2.9 
PCERM (Party for the Full Emancipation of 
    Romanies in Macedonia)                       1.8 
Democratic Party of Turks in Macedonia           0.8 
MAAK                                             0.3 
Another party                                    4.0 
Undecided                                       18.6 
Would not vote                                   6.6 

   VECER noted that some parties fared better in certain cities than 
their overall scores indicate.  For example, the DP was about twice 
as popular in Skopje as elsewhere, getting 12.1 percent in the 
capital; the VMRO-DPMNE was more popular in Bitola, getting 15.7 
percent, than in the remainder of the country; and the LP in the 
Bregalnica area got the support of 10.6 percent, substantially 
higher than the 3.2 percent support it received overall. 

   Question: "Do you have confidence in the following parties?" (all 
numbers are percentages) 

              Yes           No       Do Not Know 

SDSM           28           51          21 
VMRO-DPMNE     15           72          14 
LP             19           59          22 
PDP-NDP*       20           73           7 

*Party for Democratic Prosperity-People's Democratic Party 

   The poll clearly indicated that Macedonians have little 
confidence in any of the parties currently active in the country. 
Respondents were also asked whether it would be good for the country 
to have elections sooner than scheduled; 62 percent agreed, 20 
percent disagreed, and 18 percent did not know. These findings were 
correlated with party preferences, producing the following results: 
Of those who would vote for the SDSM, 54 percent wanted elections 
soon, while 34 percent were against early elections. However, 80 
percent of VMRO-DPMNE supporters favored elections soon, as did 79 
percent of LP supporters and 71 percent of DP supporters. While 80 
percent of those surveyed thought that a person should vote (14 
percent did not agree), only 40 percent thought that it was very 
important which party won the elections and 27 percent thought it 
was somewhat significant.

INTRODUCTION 

       This guide is intended to help users of Foreign Broadcast 
Information Service (FBIS) translations assess the value and 
reliability of media sources in the countries or regions of the 
former Yugoslavia.  It provides key information about the media 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia, Slovenia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
(incorporating Serbia and Montenegro).  Wherever possible, an 
at tempt has been made to identify affiliations or reliably 
reported connections between media sources and governmental or 
communal leadership groups. 

   All media identified in this guide are monitored by FBIS, but 
in some cases, due to wartime conditions, receipts have been 
irregular and the information provided in the guide may be 
incomplete.  Characterizations, where provided, are based on FBIS 
analysis of editorial content.  Entries are grouped by region, 
and, within regions, by category: publications, radio, 
television, and news agencies.  The "sourcelines" cited at the 
beginning of each entry are the descriptors used by FBIS to 
identify media sources of FBIS translations.  Sourcelines are 
composed of three elements--the place of origin of the medium, 
its name, and the language it uses.

maintained an independent editorial policy and was frequently 
sharply critical of the authorities.  It has become less critical

government-controlled institutions bought a controlling interest 
in the paper during a "privatization" process and replaced most 
of its management.

<TEXT>
SUMMARY 

                                 Pyongyang's response to the latest South Korean proposal for 
resumption of inter-Korean talks seems to reflect an effort by 
the North Korean regime to score polemical points against the 
South and its ongoing preference for negotiating with Washington 
over Seoul on the nuclear issue. 

                            END SUMMARY 

   Apparently violating a recent DPRK-U.S. agreement, Pyongyang 
countered Seoul's proposal for a 1 March working-level contact 
with a later date, a counterproposal that seemed aimed mainly at 
gaining some perceived polemical advantage over Seoul.  According 
to Pyongyang radio on 1 March, Pak Yong-su, North Korean chief 
delegate to the proposed working-level talks, sent a telephone 
message to his Southern counterpart proposing a meeting on 3 
March.  Pyongyang's attempt to delay the North-South meeting for 
two days seemed to violate an agreement it had reportedly reached 
with Washington for resumption of high-level DPRK-U.S talks.  The 
25 February agreement, announced by Pyongyang radio on 28 
February, specified 1 March as the date the following will take 
place "simultaneously": 

   + Seoul will announce its decision to discontinue this year's 
running of Team Spirit and Washington will announce its consent 
to Seoul's decision. 

   + The International Atomic Energy Agency will start nuclear 
inspections in the North to ensure continuity of safeguards. 

   + Inter-Korean contacts will start at Panmunjom to discuss 
exchanging of special presidential envoys. 

   + Pyongyang and Washington will announce resumption of high-level 
bilateral talks to take place on 21 March in Geneva. 

   Pyongyang's Motives In proposing a later date for North-South 
contacts, Pyongyang may have been showing its concern about 
appearing to cave in to pressure on the issue of nuclear 
inspections and its continued reluctance to deal with anyone but 
Washington on the nuclear issue.  In the latest attempt to 
portray Seoul as irrelevant on the nuclear issue, the party paper 
Nodong Sinmun in a 28 February commentary ridiculed ROK President 
Kim Yong-sam for allegedly acting "as if he receives U.S. reports 
on DPRK-U.S. talks" and "as if he controls the talks" (Pyongyang 
radio, 28 February).  Kim creates this impression, the commentary 
added, even though "he is not even qualified to join the talks." 

   Pyongyang's reluctance to engage Seoul in anything of substance 
was also evident in the sheer contempt for President Kim North 
Korea expressed in commenting on Kim's 25 February press 
conference commemorating the first year of his presidency. 
Departing from its past practice of avoiding extreme personal 
attacks on South Korean leaders during periods of inter-Korean 
dialogue, the North Korean news agency KCNA on 27 February heaped 
abuse on President Kim, calling him, inter alia, a "traitor," a 
"puppet," and a "political mountebank," accusing him of "arch 
crimes of flunkeyism, treachery, fascism, repression," and 
promoting national "division and confrontation," and  of plain 
"stupidity."  KCNA went on to claim that Kim's remarks about the 
probable absence of nuclear arms in the North and his proposal 
for an inter-Korean summit constituted a de facto admission that 
his "criminal" policy "against the North" had been wrong.  The 
party paper Nodong Sinmun on 28 February similarly ridiculed 
Kim's "preposterously absurd remarks" (Pyongyang radio). 

   DPRK-U.S. Talks In sharp contrast to its reluctance to meet 
with Seoul, Pyongyang was upbeat about the prospect of upcoming 
talks with Washington.  Although monitored Pyongyang media have 
not commented on the news of the upcoming high-level bilateral 
talks, Ambassador Ho Chong, deputy chief of North Korea's mission 
to the United Nations, was depicted in South Korean media as 
being optimistic about the eventual outcome of the negotiations. 
In an interview with the Seoul daily Hangyore Sinmun (28 
February), Ho termed it "fortunate" that Washington, "although 
belatedly," withdrew "unjustified preconditions" to resumption of 
the high-level talks, thus paving way for "a package solution" of 
"not only the nuclear issue, but also other issues now standing 
in the way of diplomatic normalization. 

   Implications Pyongyang's contrasting media treatment of 
Washington and Seoul indicates that the North Korean leadership 
continues to prefer the United States as partner for nuclear 
negotiations and is inclined to limit talks with the South to the 
minimum required to fulfill preconditions to resumption of high- 
level talks with Washington.

The     following summaries highlight information from articles that 
appeared in the Algiers French- and regional Arabic-language press 
in January and February. 

   Liamine Zeroual's Image Favorable 

   A report in the Arabic-language Doha (Qatar) daily AL-SHARQ of 3 
February states that the public views newly elected President 
Liamine Zeroual as a very shrewd and experienced military man who 
can return Algeria "to the days of Boumedienne."  According to the 
report,  Zeroual is seen as the man who can end the confrontation 
between the Islamists and the nationalists since he effectively 
pushed for dialogue and reconciliation when he was defense minister. 
Zeroual reportedly considers nationalism inseparable from Islam as 
part of his new national order:  "Zeroual goes back to the origins 
of the Algerian revolution when nationalism embraced Islam during 
the battle for independence.  In the sixties the two diverged. 
Nationalism embraced socialism and Islam was marginalized.  When 
socialism failed, Islam came back forcefully."  Zeroual has 
reportedly created a positive image through his efforts as defense 
minister to deal in a positive manner with both the (Islamic 
Salvation Front) FIS and the regime.  As a result, FIS leader Rabah 
Kebir says his party anticipates that Zeroual will change policy, 
but not necessarily replace government officials.  According to the 
report, Kebir's statement indicates that the FIS is becoming more 
flexible and wants to undertake serious dialogue with authorities, 
particularly in light of the communications that took place before 
and after the National Dialogue in January. 

   Influx of Refugees in the South Provokes Concern 

   French-language Algiers daily EL WATAN of 10 and 23 January has 
reported that Algerian Tuareg frustration and anger is growing in 
Tamanrasset because of the high number of illegal foreigners (mainly 
from Niger, Mali, and Ghana) who reportedly outnumber Algerians in 
the region.  The Tuaregs hold these foreigners responsible for 
increasing crime rates, attacks against tourists, and drug 
trafficking which weakens the economy and creates a security problem 
in the region.  Hadj Moussa Akhmokh, a prominent Tuareg authority, 
says a 1992 plan to improve regional security was unsuccessful and 
that "the situation has become worse."  In December, for example, 
the two national firms National Company for Mining Research 
(SONAREM) and Center for Energy Research (CREM) were looted and 
several vehicles were stolen. In addition, customs officials from 
Tamanrasset were kidnapped by a group of individuals armed with 
Kalashnikovs, robbed, and taken to Niger where they were manhandled 
before being released. According to Hadj Akhamokh, the more recent 
kidnapping of 18 Tuaregs (10 Algerians and eight Malians) set a 
"serious" precedent and was the 
"last straw." Citizens planned a peaceful march to demonstrate their 
anger and to attract the attention of authorities until Hadj 
Akhamokh convinced them to postpone the march.  Hadj Akhmokh stated 
the Tuaregs have responded to his appeal, but that they are 
"impatient," and are waiting for the government to take control of 
the situation. 

   According to Hadj Akhamokh, smuggling is also a serious problem. 
He faults local police for participating in the corruption and 
allowing it to continue.  Food shipments intended for the local 
population are being purchased and resold for twice the price across 
the border, including milk which has been unavailable in the markets 
for "months."  According to Hadj Akhmokh, "smuggling has grown to 
proportions that the Tuaregs can no longer tolerate. To starve the 
people is to push us to revolt." (See FBIS FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE FB PN 
93-151 "Regional Census Prompted by Security, Economic Concerns," 8 
April 1993, and NEAR EAST SOUTH ASIA REPORT 93AFO622B "Illegal 
Immigrants in South; Census Unreported," 12 May 1993 p 11 for 
additional reporting on this subject.) 

   'Terrorists' Exert Pressure; Press, Lifestyle Threatened 

   EL WATAN of 16 January reported that "terrorist threats" have 
promoted a climate of fear in the town of Meftah, "imposing a life 
style that has nothing to do with Algerian society."  According to 
the report, Meftah and Medea have become towns which immerse 
themselves more and more in Islamic, even "fundamentalist," 
tendencies.  For example, the article stated that tracts posted 
throughout Meftah threaten that women who do not wear the hijab and 
who wear Western style clothes will "have to deal with us."  In 
addition threats have been made against beauty salons, Moorish 
baths, and cassette vendors.  "Fundamentalists" have also attacked 
the press, declaring it "unsuitable reading."  EL WATAN reported in 
three articles from 16 to 18 January that newspaper vendors and 
bookstores in Blida, Medea, ChIef, and El Khemis were no longer 
selling newspapers.  According to EL WATAN of 16 January, national 
publications, particularly those of the independent press, have 
suddenly disappeared from the shelves due to "terrorist threats." 
One citizen reported, "Don't use my name, but I am afraid to tell 
you that tobacco shops and bookstores are scared to death. They are 
convinced that if they continue to sell newspapers there could be 
serious reprisals."  EL WATAN of 17 and 18 January reported that 
vendors have denied the threats, blaming distributors for failing to 
deliver the newspapers.  Nonetheless, security services have ordered 
merchants to sell newspapers or be shut down. 

   Citizens Reportedly Buying Visas 

   An article in the French-language daily ALGER REPUBLICAIN of 19 
January recounted the frustrations of dozens of Algerians trying to 
obtain French visas.  Given the evening curfew, many spend the night 
in nearby hotels or in the elevators or hallways of neighboring 
buildings.  According to the report, lines can begin as early as 4 
a.m., causing citizens to resort to purchasing a place in line for 
500-1000 dirhams, depending on the position in line and the time it 
is purchased.  In the words of one citizen, "It is a real stock 
exchange."  The French consulate reportedly closed for two days and 
suspended issuing visas in an effort to set up a new system whereby 
visa requests would be handled through the mail.

SUMMARY 

                                Russian officials have tried to minimize the impact on U.S.- 
Russian relations of the arrest of Aldrich Ames and his wife on 
charges of spying for the USSR and Russia against the United 
States.  Joined by Russian media commentators, they have 
criticized the involvement of high-level U.S. officials in 
publicizing the case, saying that the case involves normal 
espionage activity that all countries pursue.  In addition, 
Russian media across the political spectrum have viewed U.S. 
handling of the incident as evidence of a U.S. desire to 
marginalize Russia's international role. 

                            END SUMMARY 

   In their initial public statements on the Ames case, Russian 
officials have consistently tried to minimize the incident's 
impact on U.S.-Russian relations.  They have decried the 
publicity given to the case by high-level U.S. officials, saying 
that incidents such as the Ames case should be handled by 
intelligence agencies without involving officials at higher 
levels: 

   -- According to ITAR-TASS on 24 February, Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev said that it would be better to let the intelligence 
services handle the case and "not to politicize or ideologize the 
situation."  He emphasized that it is important for the United 
States and Russia to continue to "cooperate and not to attach 
undue, hypertrophied significance to this case."  After the 
Russians expelled a U.S. Embassy officer in retaliation for the 
U.S. expulsion of a Russian Embassy official in Washington, 
Kozyrev reiterated these views and claimed Moscow "had to resort" 
to a reciprocal expulsion but this process of "reciprocity" 
should be eliminated, "the sooner the better" (ITAR-TASS, 28 
February). 

   -- A 25 February Foreign Ministry press statement sniped at U.S. 
handling of the case, criticizing "attempts by the special 
services to drag the political leadership into their mutual 
relations," and noted that there are "appropriate channels" that 
can be "brought fully" into use to deal with such cases.  The 
statement said that if, as reported, the investigation of Ames 
had begun ten months ago, "this was sufficient time for us to be 
contacted directly" and for U.S. officials to "share their 
anxieties with us before making them public" (ITAR-TASS, 25 
February). 

   -- Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) officials refused 
to comment directly on Ames, but expressed surprise that the 
United States made such an outcry over actions FIS officials 
described as common practice for all intelligence services.  FIS 
director Yevgeniy Primakov had "no comment" on the case (ITAR- 
TASS, 23 February).  FIS press spokesman Yuriy Kobaladze noted 
that declining to comment on such allegations is the general 
practice among intelligence services and stressed "there is 
nothing new or sensational here in the fact that countries engage 
in intelligence activities" (Moscow radio, Russian TV, 23 
February).  He went on to claim that neither the United States 
nor Russia had "ever pledged to curtail intelligence activity" 
and that Washington has "been very active" in intelligence 
activity in Russia and the other newly independent states. 

   Breaking ranks, at least temporarily, with other officials, 
Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian General Staff, 
acknowledged Ames' links to Russia but later retracted this 
admission.  A 26 February ITAR-TASS report quoted Kolesnikov as 
saying "Ames worked in the UnitedStates for Russia" but 
nonetheless claiming that he had "inflicted no direct damage" on 
the United States.  On 28 February, however, Kolesnikov stated 
that the General Staff and its intelligence service "have no 
information on any links" between Ames and Soviet or Russian 
intelligence agencies.  According to ITAR-TASS, Kolesnikov went 
on to claim that "U.S. media misinterpreted" his 26 February 
statement (ITAR-TASS, 28 February). 

   Russian Media 

   Russian media across the political spectrum indignantly 
criticized U.S. handling of the case and speculated, sometimes on 
the basis of comments by unnamed officials, that the United 
States had ulterior motives in timing the public exposure of 
Ames.  Some commentators said that U.S. officials had exposed the 
case now because they wanted to create a pretext to reevaluate 
U.S.-Russian relations in the wake of the recent slowdown of 
reform in Russia, while others alleged that the United States 
wanted to take the gloss off Russia's diplomatic success in 
brokering a compromise over Sarajevo.  Media commentary, even in 
publications like Izvestiya, a strong supporter of Russian 
efforts to integrate with the West, supported the Russian 
government position and criticized the United States: 

   -- A 24 February article in Izvestiya remarked on what it saw as 
the "hypocrisy" of U.S. reaction to the Ames case, since, it 
claimed, Russia "has no less right to secret operations in the 
United States than America has to espionage in Russia."  A 25 
February article on the case headlined the question "Why Is 
Washington Making a Fuss?" and cited "competent sources" as 
speculating that the Ames' arrest was an attempt to put Moscow in 
its "place" after Russian diplomacy in Bosnia for the first time 
in recent years "cast the United States in a secondary role." 

   -- A 25 February article in the government newspaper Rossiyskaya 
Gazeta worried that the Ames case is being given "political 
overtones" reminiscent of the 1960 U-2 incident, which triggered 
a sharp downturn in U.S.-Soviet relations.  The article claimed 
that "certain forces" in the United States were trying to 
"exaggerate this affair" because they are unhappy with the new 
Chernomyrdin government and with Yeltsin's Bosnia initiative, 
which had "thwarted the hawks' attempt to resolve the Serbian 
question through air strikes" and had "suddenly and very sharply" 
increased Russia's "political weight in the international arena." 
The article concluded, however, that both the U.S. and Russian 
presidents were demonstrating a "well-balanced approach" and 
expressed hope that political relations between the two countries 
would not be aggravated. 

   -- A 25 February article in the Defense Ministry's newspaper 
Krasnaya Zvezda cited several theories advanced by unnamed 
"experts" to explain the U.S. "ballyhoo" over the case.  The 
article claimed U.S. intelligence agencies wished to get even 
after the exposure of more than 2O foreign intelligence agents, 
including U.S. spies, in the last year.  An article on 26 
February charged that the "fuss" over the "routine event" of a 
double agent's exposure is taking on an "increasingly hysterical 
character" in the United States, claiming with obvious sarcasm 
that "Langley believes that only [its agents] have the right to 
carry out intelligence activity."  Prominent Krasnaya Zvezda 
observer Aleksandr Golts, in a commentary published on 1 March, 
implicitly took issue with this analysis, however, claiming 
instead that it is Russia's newly demonstrated foreign policy 
independence that has "driven Washington berserk."  Golts 
contended that the United States is publicizing the Ames case 
because Russia's efforts to "implement an active foreign policy 
course" with its "successful initiative in the Balkans" had put 
the United States "on the sidelines" after it had become 
accustomed to "feeling that it is the only world leader, the only 
superpower."  He concluded by advocating the "vital necessity" of 
a "partnership" with the "rules of conduct. .. the same for 
everyone. 

   -- The independent pro-reform newspaper Segodnya, in a 24 
February article, warned that the Ames case would revive the "old 
outcry" that the "Russians cannot be trusted."  The article 
linked the case to Yeltsin's Bosnia initiative, particularly his 
proposal for a summit on the issue.  Claiming that Yeltsin's 
summit proposal would be "inconvenient" for Western leaders, the 
article implied that the Ames "scandal" had been whipped up to 
"remove the Russian initiative from the agenda."  A 1 March 
article cited unnamed sources as saying that Russian security 
services "are not interested in arousing passions," but that 
"influential U.S. forces" are hoping to "impose a time-out" for 
the United States to reexamine its policy toward Russia. 

   -- In an interview published in the 26 February edition of the 
labor-oriented newspaper Trud, retired KGB Major General Boris 
Solomatin, citing examples of other spy cases where there was no 
official outcry, bitterly ascribed what he called Washington's 
"inappropriate reaction" to the Ames affair to U.S. "imperial 
thinking" about Russia.  Lamenting that Russia had been 
"transformed" from an equal power whose intelligence services 
could work against those of the United States to one which now 
"has to ask permission to do so," Solomatin complained that the 
U.S. attitude is "we can, you cannot" because "we have the money" 
and "you have an outstretched hand."  Contending that the United 
States had not given much thought to the possible consequences 
when it "embarked on this scandal," Solomatin claimed that now, 
when Russians see that the "big bucks" spent on intelligence are 
"working," they will recognize the importance of intelligence and 
begin to "organize it properly." 

   Implications 

   The pains taken by Russian officials to play down the Ames affair 
and to minimize its effect on U.S.-Russian relations clearly 
indicate Moscow's desire to keep the relationship on a firm 
footing.  However, the indignant reaction on the part of both 
officials and the media to the U.S. handling of the case, as well 
as the sensitivity displayed toward perceived attempts to 
relegate Russia to a marginal role in diplomacy or intelligence 
activities, indicates that Moscow will continue to assert itself 
when it feels that the United States is trying to take unfair 
advantage.
